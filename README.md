## ⭐️ Inspiration
Meeting people at Pitt outside of clubs & classes can be difficult. We harnessed the power of google gemini to make meeting people that would make good friends across campus so much easier. 

## ⭐️ What it does
Just run the app, put in your name and write a little bit about yourself. There's no need to take any long surveys. You can write as little as possible (but the more you write the better matches you'll get!)

## ⭐️ How we built it
We constructed our backend using Flask with Python and used MongoDB Atlas to store all our users and information. Users can create an account with our app using Auth0, and our frontend relies on vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS

## ⭐️ Challenges we ran into
Interfacing between the frontend and backend in a smooth way proved to be challenging at times. Also, taking advantage of Google Gemini without exhausting its resources by making too many calls was something we had to work around. 

## ⭐️ Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're very proud of how we were able to bring all these different technologies together and make them work with one another. 

## ⭐️ What we learned
We learned a lot about general web development (especially backend) and using ML models within our code. 

## ⭐️ What's next for People At Pitt
It would be awesome to create a mobile app out of this that Pitt students could use and see true friendships arise out of it.
